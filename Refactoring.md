# Refactoring

Maybe add preconditions and postconditions?

Epsilon -> matches nothing, always returns true.
OptionalNode which is a EitherNode with Epsilon

MultiNode -> NodeList
ConditionalNodeList :> NodeList

(Post-)Conditions:
 - OneOrMore
 - ZeroOrOne
 - ZeroOrMore

CSVNode (Comma Separated Value Node)
SeparatedNodes<T> with a string Delimiter
